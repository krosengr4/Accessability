# Changes I made
- Fixed the top of the page (header with "Horiseon" and nav links) by changing two div's to header and nav.

- Found better elements to use insted of div's in the html. Such as header, nav, section, article, aside, and footer.

- Made the HTML easier to follow by spacing out and making sure each element started on the correct vertical line.

- Inserted comments of what I changed.
